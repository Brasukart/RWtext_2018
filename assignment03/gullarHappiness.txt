Happiness



Suffering is the divine way

to nothing.

It won't make a halo

around your head, it won't

illuminate the smallest

square of your dark flesh,

it won't even illuminate

the remembrance or illusion

at happiness.



you suffer, a wounded dog

suffers, an insect poisoned

by blackflag suffers.

Is your pain superior

to that of the cat you saw

with the broken back

limping along in the gutter

howling and unable to die?



         Justice is moral, injustice

indifferent. Pain

will guarantee you equality

with rats and roaches that also

glimpse from inside their drains

the sun

and in their repulsive bodies

dragging through faeces

                            wish to be happy.
