Disaster



Some wish

         their poem to be

         marble

or crystal. I wanted

mine to be a peach

         or pear

         or banana rotting on a plate

preferably

on a verandah

where people talk and work

and can hear

         the noise from the street.



         My only ambition

         is the rotten poem



the pulp wounded

         exposed

the voice deep within

                            festering
         on the plate

the liquor the chemistry

         of syllables

                            the decaying corpse

         of metaphors

         a poem

         like a disaster in progress.
