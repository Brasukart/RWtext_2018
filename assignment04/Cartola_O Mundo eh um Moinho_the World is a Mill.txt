It is still early, love
You have not yet begun to know life
And you announce it´s departure time
Not knowing what path will guide you

Heed my words, darling
Though I know you made up your mind
In every corner falls a little of your life
And soon you shall not be who you are

Pay attention, dear
The world is a grinding mill
It will crush your petty dreams
Reduce your illusions to smithereens

Pay attention, my sweetheart
From each love you shall inherit just cynicism
Before you know it, you will face the abyss
An abyss you carved with your own feet
